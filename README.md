# BMI-Calculator
This code is a Python program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person based on their weight and height. The program first prompts the user to enter their weight in kilograms and their height in meters. It then calculates the BMI using the formula.
The code then interprets the BMI value according to the following categories:

BMI < 18.5: Underweight
18.5 <= BMI < 25: Normal weight
25 <= BMI < 30: Overweight
BMI >= 30: Obese
